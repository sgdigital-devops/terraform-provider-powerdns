# powerdns\_record

Provides a PowerDNS record resource.

## Example Usage

Note that PowerDNS internally lowercases certain records (e.g. CNAME and AAAA), which can lead to resources being marked for a change in every singe plan.

For the v1 API (PowerDNS version 4):

```hcl
# Add a record to the zone
resource "powerdns_record" "foobar" {
  zone    = "example.com."
  name    = "www.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300
  records = ["192.168.0.11"]
}
```

For PTR record example:
```hcl
# Add PTR record to the zone
resource "powerdns_record" "foobar" {
  zone    = "0.10.in-addr.arpa."
  name    = "10.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa."
  type    = "PTR"
  ttl     = 300
  records = ["www.example.com."]
}
```

There is a feature in PowerDNS API for A/AAAA records to automatically create corresponding PTR records.
Existing PTR records with same name are replaced. If no matching reverse zone found, an error is thrown by API and thus Terraform. Example:

```hcl
resource "powerdns_record" "foobar" {
  zone    = "example.com."
  name    = "www.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300
  set_ptr = true
  records = ["192.168.0.11"]
}
```

For the legacy API (PowerDNS version 3.4):

```hcl
# Add a record to the zone
resource "powerdns_record" "foobar" {
  zone    = "example.com"
  name    = "www.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300
  records = ["192.168.0.11"]
}
```
